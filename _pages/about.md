As a dedicated PhD student at the University of Groningen, I am deeply immersed in the cutting-edge field of privacy and safety in language models, a key area within the larger LESSEN project. Under the guidance of my supervisor, Fatih Turkman, and co-supervisor, Suzan Verberne, my research focuses on developing innovative methods to outline the privacy and safety issues of language processing technologies. This work not only contributes to the academic community but also has significant implications for the broader application of AI in various sectors. My journey in this field reflects a commitment to advancing technology in a manner that upholds the highest standards of user privacy and data protection.
