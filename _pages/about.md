I am a third year Ph.D. student at the Bernoulli Institute, University of Groningen, where my research focuses on the privacy and safety aspects of large language models (LLMs). My doctoral work is conducted as part of the [LESSEN project](https://lessen-project.nl), which aims to develop low-resource conversational assistants. I am supervised by [Fatih Turkman]([https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=nlv_Wr0AAAAJ&hl=en](https://www.cs.rug.nl/~turkmen/)) and [Suzan Verberne](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/medewerkers/suzan-verberne#tab-1).
